= 1.1.1

* I'd initially published to Rubyforge under a 1.0.0 gem, and I've since tried to retrospectively fix up the version number system.  It turns out that Rubyforge caches old gems permanently, so I have to re-start at a larger number again.
* class name check no longer gets confused about scoped class names like Module::Classname.

= 0.5

* expanded regex matching for method name check.
* suppressed noisy output from ParseTree using facets API.
* updated dependencies and version as a result of facets change.
* made Roodi tolerant of being asked to parse files which aren't really Ruby files.
* updated the documentation with usage examples.

= 0.4

* Added support back in for line numbers in error messages.
* Re-enabled MethodLineCountCheck as part of the default check set.

= 0.3

* First version of Roodi to be published to Rubyforge.

= 0.2

* Now use ParseTree instead of JRuby, which makes the tool much more accessible.
* Removed MagicNumberCheck
* Line numbers no longer supported as a result of the move.

= 0.1

* A first version of a design checking tool for Ruby, with a few checks built in to get started.
