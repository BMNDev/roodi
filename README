== Introduction

Roodi is an acronym that stands for Ruby Object Oriented Design Inferometer.  It parses your Ruby code and warns you about design issues you have based on the checks that is has configured.

== Usage

TBD.  See the Rakefile in this project for an example of how to get started if you're on the bleeding edge.

== Background

Roodi is almost identical in design to the Java tool called Checkstyle (http://checkstyle.sf.net/), however it is named after the Java tool that I worked on called Joodi (http://joodi.checkstyle.net).  I think it's more appropriate to name it similarly to Joodi than Checkstyle, because the checks exist to warn you about design issues, not style issues.  Joodi has a different design, but a better name.  I used a combination of each.

== Design

The design of Roodi is intriguing.  It basically builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of the Ruby source code, then uses the visitor patten to walk every node in the tree and see if the checks can infer any design issues with them.  Usually, the existence of an AST would mean running a grammar file through a parser to build it.  No such grammar file exists for the Ruby language, so I used the object model built by the JRuby team instead.  However, Roodi is written in Ruby to be more attractive to the Ruby community.  It does have to be run through JRuby because it uses the JRuby API.

So I end up using JRuby to run a Ruby app that uses JRuby API's to parse Ruby code.

== Checks currently supported
	ClassNameCheck					Check that class names match convention.
	CyclomaticComplexityBlockCheck	Check that the cyclomatic complexity of all blocks is below the threshold.
	CyclomaticComplexityMethodCheck	Check that the cyclomatic complexity of all methods is below the threshold.
	EmptyRescueBodyCheck			Check that there are no empty rescue blocks.
	ForLoopCheck					Check that for loops aren't used (Use Enumerable.each instead)
	MethodNameCheck					Check that method names match convention.
	MethodLineCountCheck			Check that all methods have a line count lower than the threshold
